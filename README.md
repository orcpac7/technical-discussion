## In support of Duke University/Coursera online course on Cloud Computing Foundations

I have not been treating this as a proper Git project, branching, versoning, etc. Instead, I have concentrated on installing the different tools I thought I neeed to do the assignments, *locally*.

Now that I've discovered how to followw the Lab button, I'll work on using the usual GIT workflow.

And now for something different, soapbox time!

- Asciidoc VS Markdown

Asciidoc excels for creating segmented documents, as for instance, a book with chapters

Markdown is more widely supported, as for instance in Github

However by utilizing PanDoc's ability to convert from most any format to other formats that advantage goes away for the most part. Still, Markdown is good for quick one-offs where basic text formatting, links, images will suffice. That's the basic, or strict markdown. There are many variations, dialects if you will, of Markdown that have been extended.

- Gists

This is an example [gist](https://gist.github.com/orcpac7/6815d1fe914fb7401f202597a5670e4e)

- Semantic Versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

- Semantic Markup

Structural, semantic HTML is the key starting point toward good accessibility practices.

When a screen reader, or any sort of assistive device scans a web page, it gets information about the Document Object Model (DOM), or the HTML structure of the page. No styles or JavaScript will be read by a screen reader.

Many screen readers have functionality that allows a user to select to read only the headings on the page, or only the links. Giving precedence to the way headings and links are written is a significant way we can make browsing the web easier for these users.
